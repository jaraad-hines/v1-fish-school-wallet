# 🐟Fish School Wallet

## Overview
🎨 **Building a Trustless Wallet for Fish School**
* **Wallet container rail**: A full-screen “Wallet” frame with status bar (network, block, codehash OK).

* **Wallet object rail**: Cards (Admission, Treasury, Governance, Rules). Each with:

  - Title + type icon (Guardian, Treasury, etc.).

  - Status preview (balances, members, proposals).

  - Security chip (Verified • Block 19,343,231).

* **Object preview rail**: Click any card → opens sub-view:

  - Treasury → live balance tiles + recent transfers.

  - Governance → list of proposals, quorum meters.

  - Factory → list of RuleModules with schema tags (Crowdfund, Royalty Split).

* **Drive-style browsing**: RuleModules display like Google Drive tiles, each tile showing describe() + params summary.
